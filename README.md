# Passive-vibration-control-considering-SSI-
In this algorithm soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects are investigated while an array of Pressurized Tuned Liquid Column Dampers (PTLCD) is employed for seismic vibration control of buildings. For the time-domain analysis, a computational routine is developed for the linearization of the equilibrium equations of the PTLCD, as well as details for the reduction to the other types of passive dampers.
